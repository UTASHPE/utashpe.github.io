              <p>I have had the honor to serve as the community outreach coordinator, Vice President, and President for SHPE UTA. As the community outreach coordinator, I planned at least one community outreach event every month and encouraged members to attend the events. I also began the first collaboration with Trinity SHPE Jr. and Lockheed Martin HOLA and SHPE AERO to plan a community outreach event. By serving as the Lead Coordinator for HEB ISD ACE Science Day, there has been an increase of students and volunteers attending ACE Science Day. In 2017, 65 students and 25 volunteers attended the event, and several professionals from Lockheed Aero believed it had been the smoothest event they have had. In 2018, the event was even more successful than the previous year, and 105 students and 35 volunteers attended. Both events were planned under a rigorous budget of $500.00, but by leading a successful budget management plan, both events were exactly on budget. This collaboration of participating with Trinity SHPE Jr. Chapter and Lockheed Martin and SHPE Aero have resulted in being awarded the Blue Heart Chip Award, which is awarded by SHPE National, in RLDC 2017 and RLDC 2018.</p>
              <p>As president, I have focused in rebuilding our relationship with SHPE DFW Chapter which has resulted in meeting professionals and corporate representatives who are interested in investing in SHPE UTA or help SHPE UTA members obtain employment/internships in their companies. I have also attended all of events hosted by Lockheed Martin SHPE Aero, and this relationship could potentially lead to more opportunities to help members get hired or prepared for interviews as well as possibly obtain more funding to help more members attend the National Conference. I have also focused in seeking to work with more engineering and Hispanic organizations that have similar goals as SHPE like I did with the Microsoft Tech Talk with NSBE.</p>

              <p>Hello everyone I am Steve A. Berdote and I am running for SHPE President. Why I am running for SHPE President? I want to make SHPE the top engineering organization on campus known by all.</p>
              <p>What makes me a good candidate? I have now been with SHPE for 2 years and have grown as an individual and as a leader. I started off as Community Outreach leading Enginering Saturdays and helping with Noche de Ciencias and ACE Day. I Have been working as our SHPE Jr. Chair to build relations with the students of Polytechnic High School. I have learned much of what is needed to lead and coordinate people I work with.</p>
              <p>What I plan to do for our members? I will invest our resources more into our members allowing for more opportunities both off and on campus. Finding new ways to make getting involved with SHPE more convenient for our members. Acknowledge members participation and achievements within SHPE. Increase member participation in conferences for regional and national.</p>
              <p>What I plan to do to make our organization better? Going on a full publicity campaign to get our name out on campus. Holding our officers accountable for their duties and actions. Creating a well structured system for our officers to follow that will bring efficiency and order. Allowing our organization to connect with other organizations both at the professional and university levels. Increasing the number of social events and public outreach.</p>

              <p>I am highly organized, have great interpersonal skills, and a strong advocate for female empowerment. A panel once a semester geared towards Latinas in STEM is a great foundation to start with in establishing a strong SHPEtina community. However, I plan on doing little side projects that will impact the chapter on a personal level such as having a #WCW on the chapterâ€™s social media in which the chapter recognizes a SHPEtina member/alum. Or have a SHPEtina take over on social media to learn more about their POV and why they chose STEM. There is a lot of potential for inner growth within the chapter for this position and I hope you choose me to see it come to fruition.</p>
